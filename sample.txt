Robert Graves (1895-1985): A Literary Biography

Robert von Ranke Graves was a renowned English poet, historical novelist, and critic. Born on July 24, 1895, in Wimbledon, London, he became one of the most influential literary figures of the 20th century.

Early Life and World War I
Graves attended Charterhouse School and later enrolled at St John's College, Oxford. His education was interrupted by World War I, where he served as an officer in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. His wartime experiences profoundly influenced his poetry and prose. He was severely wounded at the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and was even mistakenly reported as having died of his wounds.

Literary Career
Graves is perhaps best known for his historical novels, particularly "I, Claudius" (1934) and "Claudius the God" (1935), which brought ancient Rome to life through the eyes of Emperor Claudius. These novels were later adapted into a celebrated BBC television series.

As a poet, Graves published his first collection of poems in 1916. His autobiography "Good-bye to All That" (1929) is considered one of the most significant memoirs of World War I, providing a brutal and honest account of his wartime experiences.

The White Goddess
In 1948, Graves published "The White Goddess," a controversial work of mythology and poetic inspiration. In this book, he proposed that true poetry is inspired by the Muse, whom he identified with the ancient Mother Goddess. This work significantly influenced his later poetry and the development of goddess spirituality movements.

Personal Life
Graves had a turbulent personal life. He married twice and had eight children. From 1929 onwards, he lived most of his life in Deià, Majorca, Spain, where he continued to write prolifically. The Spanish island became his creative sanctuary.

Later Years and Legacy
Throughout his long career, Graves wrote more than 140 works, including poetry, novels, translations, and scholarly works on mythology. He held the position of Professor of Poetry at Oxford from 1961 to 1966.

Graves continued writing until his death on December 7, 1985, in Deià. His influence on English literature, particularly in poetry and historical fiction, remains significant. His works continue to be studied and admired for their craftsmanship, historical insight, and mythological depth.
